## Overview

The **neuronauts-be** project provides the backend functionalities required to process semantic word embeddings and facilitate real-time multiplayer gameplay. It leverages pre-trained word embeddings from [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) to perform fast and accurate semantic similarity checks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuronauts-be.git
   cd neuronauts-be
   ```

## Setup

### Download and Prepare GloVe Embeddings

The backend relies on the `glove.6B.200d.txt` file for semantic processing. Follow these steps to set up the embeddings:

1. **Download and Extract GloVe:**

   Download the GloVe package and unzip it:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
   unzip glove.6B.zip
   ```

2. **Place the Embeddings File:**

   Move the `glove.6B.200d.txt` file to the root directory of the project.

3. **Convert GloVe to JSON:**

   Run the provided script to convert the GloVe text file to a JSON format that the backend can more easily process:

   ```bash
   python clove_to_json.py
   ```

   This will generate a JSON file containing the word embeddings for use by the server.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start the backend server.

```bash
node server.js
```
